- Created an Employee Database Application which involves a driver program that will use the classes, to build an application for an Employee Database.
- All employee data is stored in a file called empdata.dat.
- Each time you run the program, the user is allowed to repeatedly select from the five choices described below: 
<list>
  <ol>1. Add a new employee</ol>
  <ol>2. Print all employee data for all the employees in the file</ol> 
  <ol>3. Compute and print the employee name and compensation of all employees</ol>
  <ol>4. Print the employee name with vehicle information vehicles with mileage greater than 78000 miles</ol>
  <ol>5. Exit the application</ol>
</list>

- The first time you execute the program, your file will have no employees in it. Second time onwards, all employee data from previous executions of the program, should be available
